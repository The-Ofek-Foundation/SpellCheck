3) put some clothes in the washer. I heard the smoke alarm. 4) I think, â€œSomeone is
burning 5) something I put the soap in the washer. When I got 6) up to stairs, everybody
was running outdoors. Two fire trucks and a police car were outside of my house. Smoke
was coming out of my apartment! My kids 7) standing outside. They were 8) wearing
their pajamas. My kids! Oh no! My toast!
